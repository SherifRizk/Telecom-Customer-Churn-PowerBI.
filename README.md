## üéØ Project Overview

This project transforms raw, flat-file data into a robust Star Schema data model using Power Query to optimize performance and clarity. The analysis is presented through a three-page interactive dashboard designed to answer key business questions:

1.  **Descriptive Analysis:** What is the overall business performance?
2.  **RFM Analysis:** Who are our most valuable customers?
3.  **Churn Analysis:** Why are customers leaving and who is at the highest risk?
